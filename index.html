<h1>A Worldwide Library</h1>
<h2>One place at a time.</h2>

<p>Invigorate people's interest in the joy of reading by exposing them to good reads in unexpected places. Join a worldwide movement of friendly readers who intentionally 
leave a book behind they love, cherish, and want to share.</p>

<p>We encourage leaving books in motel rooms, local coffee shops, airline seats, or tables in a waiting room - any place where they will find a good home.</p>

<p>Our <a href="mission.html">mission statement</a> is available on bookmarks that you can print out yourself at home or order online at
a variety of retailers.</p>

<p>Leave a bookmark in the book to spread the word around the world.</p>


<p>You can make a difference in countless people's lives by simply leaving something behind.</p>
